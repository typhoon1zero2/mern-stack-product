## `A Single-Page-Application(SPA) - MERN((MongoDB, Express, React and Node)) Full Stack .`

### DESCRIPTION

```js
we are using Full Stack JavaScript to design and develop our applications. 
This means we would be using Node, Express and MongoDB to design the REST APIs and then we would use those APIs in our React frontend.
